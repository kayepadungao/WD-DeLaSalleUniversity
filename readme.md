## Overview

<!-- TODO: To be changed -->
<!-- The following are just sample -->
This project involved designing and developing a website similar to De La Salle University's (DLSU) official platform, with the primary objective of providing a dynamic and user-friendly online space for students, faculty, staff, and visitors to access essential information. The website is structured to showcase academic programs, admissions procedures, research initiatives, campus events, and university news. It serves as an interactive and comprehensive resource hub for current and prospective students.

The project involved creating a website that closely mirrors the structure and functionality of De La Salle University's (DLSU) official site. It aimed to design an engaging, user-friendly platform for accessing information about academic programs, admissions, campus life, research, and university news.
The purpose of this project was to develop a comprehensive, interactive website that provides essential information to students, prospective applicants, faculty, and staff. It serves as an online hub where users can easily find details about the university’s academic offerings, admission processes, and campus resources while ensuring ease of navigation across various devices.

The website includes several key components: the Homepage, which highlights important announcements and provides quick access to various sections; Academic Programs, offering detailed information about degree programs, courses, and faculty; Admissions, providing prospective students with the application process, eligibility, and deadlines; Campus Life, detailing student organizations, events, and campus facilities; Research, showcasing the university’s research initiatives and collaborations; and News & Events, which keeps users updated with the latest university news and upcoming events. Additionally, the site features a Search Functionality, allowing users to quickly find specific content across the website.

VS Code: Used as the integrated development environment (IDE) for writing and managing the website's code, allowing for efficient development and debugging.
HTML & CSS: These were used to structure and style the content of the website. HTML formed the backbone of the website, while CSS handled the layout, typography, and overall design elements.
JavaScript: Used to add interactivity to the website, such as form validations, dynamic content loading, and interactive event handling (like buttons and navigation menus). JavaScript also helped enhance user engagement by creating a responsive and smooth user experience.
Responsive Design: CSS media queries were utilized to ensure the website’s responsiveness, making it accessible and properly formatted across desktops, tablets, and mobile devices.

## Rules, Practices and Principles
1. Always use `WD-` in the front of the Title of the Project for the Subject followed by your custom naming.
2. Do not rename any .html files; always use `index.html` as the filename.
3. Place Files in their respective folders.
4. All file naming are in camel case.
   - Camel case is naming format where there is no white space in separation of each words, the first word is in all lower case while the succeding words first letter are in upper followed by lower cased letters.
   - ex.: buttonAnimatedStyle.css
5. Use only `External CSS`.
6. Renaming of Pages folder names are a must, and relates to what it is doing or data it holding.
7. File Structure to follow below.

```
